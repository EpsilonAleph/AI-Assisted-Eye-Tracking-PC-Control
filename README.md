# AI-Assisted-Eye-Tracking-PC-Control

---

An experimental academic project to help people with movement disabilities to be able to use a personal computer.

---

This is a prototype project, it has a lot flaws and is not as accurate as it should be. I'll be updating this project in the near future, I'll add an infrared global shutter monochrome camera to the setup to hopefully increase the accuracy by 40-50 %.
I'll be more than happy to get any kind of contribution, improvements or ideas, thanks in advance.
